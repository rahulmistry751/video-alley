      "Harry Potter's adventures continue...After a long summer with the horrid Dursleys, Harry Potter is thwarted in his attempts to board the train to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to begin his second year. Harry's only transportation option is a magical flying car, but, unfortunately, it crashes into a valuable (and clearly vexed) Whomping Willow. Still, all this seems like a day in the park compared to what awaits Harry that fall within the haunted halls of Hogwarts. Chilling, malevolent voices whisper from the walls only to Harry, and it seems certain that his classmate Draco Malfoy is out to get him. Soon it's not just Harry who is worried about survival, as dreadful things begin to happen at the school. The mysteriously gleaming foot-high words on the wall proclaim: 'The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware.' But what exactly does it all mean? Harry, Hermione, and Ron do everything that is wizardly possible--including risking their own lives--to solve this 50-year-old, potentially deadly mystery.",

The only clue to where Sirius is headed: The Azkaban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep "He's at Hogwarts ... He's at Hogwarts.

      `Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts for his fifth year--and his greatest challenge yet . . .

      A summer has passed since Harry's encounter with the Dark Lord, and Harry returns to learn that the wizarding community remains in denial about Voldemort's return; the minister of magic believes that Headmaster Dumbledore is lying; and a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher has been assigned. Now, with the entire wizard community in peril, the future of magic may depend on Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
      
      When the new professor, Dolores Umbridge's (Imelda Staunton--Nanny McPhee, Vera Drake), Ministry-approved course of defensive magic leaves the young wizards woefully unprepared to protect themselves against the dark forces threatening them and the entire wizarding community, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) urge Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) to act. Meeting secretly with a small group of students who name themselves "Dumbledore's Army," Harry teaches them how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, working with a secret order of wizards calling themselves The Order of the Phoenix to prepare the courageous young wizards for the extraordinary battle that lies ahead.
